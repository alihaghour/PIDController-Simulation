PID Controller Simulation
This project provides a C++ implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.
It includes a DC motor model with electrical and mechanical parameters, allowing for both position control (servo) and speed control simulations. 
The simulation outputs data to CSV files for visualization and analysis (I prefer to use GNU plot)
